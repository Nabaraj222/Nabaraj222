# Hi, I'm Nabaraj Ghimire 👋

I'm a Principal Software Engineer with specialized knowledge and experience in designing and building enterprise-grade applications.

**Tech Expertise:**  
- Backend: ASP.NET Core, C#, MS-SQL, PostgreSQL  
- Frontend: Angular, React, JQuery  
- UI: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap  

I love working at the intersection of engineering, system architecture, and product thinking.  
When I’m not coding, you'll find me reading, music, swimming, hiking, or anything that fuels my curiosity and balance.
