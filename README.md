# Hi, I'm Nabaraj Ghimire 👋

I'm a **Principal Software Engineer** with deep experience in designing and building enterprise-grade applications.

**Tech Expertise:**  
- Backend: ASP.NET Core, C#, MS-SQL, PostgreSQL  
- Frontend: Angular, React, JQuery  
- UI: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap  

I love working at the intersection of **engineering, system architecture, and product thinking**.  
When I’m not coding, you'll find me **reading, swimming, or hiking** - anything that fuels curiosity and balance.
